       My features have been carried through generations. My features come from two strong and resilient families. They have traveled across the sea, to a new country, learned a new language, a new culture. I have my mother's nose, my father's eyebrows, my great-grandma's dimple, my grandfather's height, & my great-aunt's hair. I am a genetic collage of the people who have sacrificed for me, who have loved me.
